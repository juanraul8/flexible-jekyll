I"£<p>The project goal is creating a sandbox to experiment with physically-based rendering algorithms based on the ray tracing system. The sandbox consists of predefined environments with scenes including assets such as: 
geometry, materials, light sources and textures. The implementation is based on the <a href="https://vulkan-tutorial.com/">Vulkan pipeline</a> and it has been tested on a Geforce GTX 1060 and GeForce RTX 2070. More details about
the foundations can be found in the amazing <a href="http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/contents.html">PBR book</a>.</p>

<p>The iniative and almost all work has been done by Wojciech Zielonka. If you are interested on this project, then you may find interesting his project <a href="https://github.com/Zielon/PBRenderer">Physically Based Rendering Engine</a> too!</p>
