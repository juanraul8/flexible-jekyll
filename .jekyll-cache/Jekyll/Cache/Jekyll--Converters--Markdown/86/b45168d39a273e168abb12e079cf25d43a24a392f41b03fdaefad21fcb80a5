I"y<p>For my guided research project, we present an image-based relighting method that can synthesize scenes under novel lighting using image synthesis models based on deep learning. Our method extends <a href="https://justusthies.github.io/posts/deferred-neural-rendering/">the Deffered Neural Rendering pipeline</a> to perform relighting tasks. This pipeline combines the traditional graphics pipeline with learnable components: neural textures and deferred neural ren- derer. We evaluate extensively the effectiveness of our approach in several experiments, on both synthetic and real scenes. Results prove that Neu- ral Rendering pipeline is able to reproduce complex relighting tasks like modeling high frequency lighting effects such as specularities and shadows.</p>
